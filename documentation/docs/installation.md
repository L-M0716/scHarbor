# Installation

!!! info "Installation overview"
    scHarbor is distributed as an Apptainer container. 
    Setup involves obtaining the workflow, building the container image, and verifying that the container runs successfully.
   

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Apptainer | Required on a compatible execution host to run the scHarbor SIF image |
| scHarbor repository | Provides the launcher, workflow rules, configuration, and build definition |
| Disk space | Allow space for input data, references, intermediate objects, and results |

R, Python, Snakemake, STAR (including STARsolo), and analysis packages are supplied through the
container rather than installed individually on the host. The commands below use a Bash-compatible
shell on the machine running Apptainer.

## 1. Check Apptainer

```bash
apptainer --version
```

If the command is unavailable, install Apptainer following its
[official installation guide](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/latest/installation.html),
or use the runtime provided by your computing facility. 
A container image does not replace the host container runtime.

## 2. Get the workflow

Download the scHarbor source code and enter the repository directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/L-M0716/scHarbor.git
cd scHarbor
```

## 3. Build the image

Run from the repository root, where `run_workflow`, `workflow1/`, and `build/` are located:

```bash
apptainer build --fakeroot scRNA_seq.sif \
  build/scRNA_seq.def
```

!!! note "Build requirements"
    The build needs network access to retrieve the base image and dependencies, sufficient space
    for temporary files and the final SIF image, and support for `--fakeroot` on the execution host.
    Keep the repository files referenced by the definition available during the build.

## 4. Verify the runtime

```bash
apptainer exec scRNA_seq.sif echo "Container started successfully"
apptainer exec scRNA_seq.sif snakemake --version
apptainer exec scRNA_seq.sif STAR --version
apptainer exec scRNA_seq.sif R --version

apptainer exec \
  -B "$PWD":/opt/scRNA_workflow \
  scRNA_seq.sif \
  bash /opt/scRNA_workflow/run_workflow --help
```

Run these commands from the repository root. `$PWD` is the host repository directory, mounted at
`/opt/scRNA_workflow` inside the container. Workflow arguments must refer to paths accessible inside
the container. These checks verify startup and executable availability; they do not run an analysis.

## 5. Verify the workflow with bundled data

The image includes a compact four-sample matrix dataset and its matching metadata,
configuration, and marker table. Run the bundled test to verify the complete workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p demo_results

apptainer exec \
  -B "$PWD/demo_results":/results \
  scRNA_seq.sif \
  bash /opt/scRNA_workflow/run_workflow \
    -I matrix \
    -D /opt/scRNA_workflow/workflow1/src/config/matrix_files \
    -C /opt/scRNA_workflow/workflow1/src/config/config.yaml \
    -S /opt/scRNA_workflow/workflow1/src/config/samples.demo.tsv \
    -M /opt/scRNA_workflow/build/resources/ImmGen/markerlist.tsv \
    -R /results \
    -t all
```

Successful completion verifies container startup, workflow dependencies, matrix input,
preprocessing, hierarchical annotation, and downstream modules. The bundled subset is
for software validation only and is not suitable for biological interpretation.

See [Quick Start](quickstart.md#run-the-bundled-demo) for dataset details and a dry-run command.

## 6. Installation troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| `apptainer: command not found` | Install or load the host Apptainer runtime before running the workflow |
| Missing source file during build | Run from the repository root and check the paths in the definition's `%files` section |
| Dependency download failure | Check network access and the first failing download in the build log |
| `No space left on device` | Check the output, temporary, and cache locations, including storage quotas |
| `failed to mount proc` or `operation not permitted` | Check host container permissions and fakeroot support with the system administrator; this error alone does not show that the image is damaged |
| Input file missing inside the container | Check the bind mount and the container-side path |
| Container startup check fails | Resolve the error from `apptainer exec scRNA_seq.sif echo "Container started successfully"` before testing the workflow; analysis parameters cannot fix a container startup failure |
